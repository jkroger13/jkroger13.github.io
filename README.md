I am a Policy Analysis Ph.D. candidate at the RAND School of Public Policy and an Assistant Policy Research at the RAND Corporation. My research focuses on economic wellbeing and I am writing my dissertation on the relationship between financial assistance and food security and financial wellbeing. I have experience conducting applied microeconomic research and am also interested in behavioral finance and policies that can improve educational and career outcomes for workers. In addition to my Ph.D., I hold degrees in policy analysis, economics, statistics, and international development. Prior to joining RAND, I worked as research specialist writing research for corporate finance and procurement leaders.

Here, you can find copies of my CV, job market paper, and published work.
