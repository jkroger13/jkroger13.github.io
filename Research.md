# Working Papers

### <a href="Kroger_JMP_Financial Assistance and Food Insecurity.pdf"> “Determining the Impact of Pandemic Financial Assistance on Household Food Insecurity" </a>
September 2025  
(Presented at Association for Public Policy Analysis & Management Annual Fall Research Conference)  
This paper assesses the impact of the substantial increases to cash assistance received by low- and middle-income households during the pandemic on their likelihood of experiencing food insecurity. I use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and variation in benefit amounts to construct estimate the total amount of financial assistance households received in 2020 and 2021 from SNAP emergency allotments, Pandemic-EBT, and advanced child tax credit payments. The panel structure of the SIPP allows me to account for unobservable household characteristics that current research on these policies does not fully account for. Variation based on household characteristics and specific state policy choices provides the basis for quasi-experimental changes to financial support which I link to declines in the likelihood that a household was food insecure. The impacts of these changes were larger for low-income households and appear to be concentrated among unmarried and female-headed households. My panel results are larger than a cross-sectional analysis using the same data would conclude, suggesting that research to date may have underestimated the importance of these policies in combatting food insecurity during the pandemic.

### <a href="Kroger_ACCI_2023.pdf"> “The Effect of Financial Education Mandates on Educational Debt Payment Hardship” </a>
May 2023  
(Presented at 2023 American Council on Consumer Interests Conference)  
This paper uses the introduction of state financial education mandates to estimate the impact of financial education on student debt outcomes among young adults. I use changes to exposure to financial education in high school stemming from financial education mandates and data from the Survey of Household Economic Decision Making (SHED) to conclude that increased financial education in response to these mandates is associated with a 5.5% decrease in the likelihood recent college graduates are behind on their student debt payments. Given the variation in treatment timing, I test these results using updated difference-in-differences models and conclude that the results are robust for just a subset of the sample who reported only ‘doing OK’ financially but not for those who reported struggling or being comfortable financially.  

### <a href="Kroger_Disparities in Student Debt Burdens.pdf"> "Racial Disparities in Student Loan Burdens and Debt Cancellation" </a>
November 2022  
This short analysis uses data in the SHED to document racial disparities in student debt burdens and the how different plans for cancellation would impact these disparities. While broad-based loan cancellation can reduce disparities, it would require substantial amounts of forgiveness above any proposed plan to eliminate disparities. Better targeted cancellations based on income, length and amount of debt, or other factors would likely be more effective.

# Published Journal Articles

<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41372-023-01823-0"> “Changes in Perceptions of Antibiotic Stewardship Among Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Providers Over the Course of a Learning Collaborative: A Prospective, Multisite, Mixed-Methods Evaluation” </a>  
Nabeel Qureshi, Jack Kroger, Kenneth Zangwill, Neha Joshi, Kurlen Payton, Peter Mendel  
Published in the Journal of Perinatology, 2024  
This paper examines the impact of a learning collaborative on perceptions of antibiotic stewardship at a selection of California NICUs. I assisted with the thematic coding of pre and post interviews for the collaborative and analyzed data on progress participating hospitals made toward their stewardship goals.  

<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289009"> “Disciplinary Trends in the Use of the Delphi Method: A Bibliometric Analysis”  </a>  
Dmitry Khodyakov, Sean Grant, Jack Kroger, Catria Gadwah-Meaden, Aneesa Motala, Jody Larkin  
Published in PLoS One, 2023  
This paper examines the evolution of the use of the Delphi method across disciplines from its creation in the 1960s to the present. I participated in the abstract screening to create the data for the paper and drafted text and figures of the bibliometric analysis.


# Published RAND Reports

<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2441-1.html"> “An Integrated Model of Recruiting Resources: Optimal Resource Allocation for Regular Army and Army Reserve Recruiting,” </a>  
Avery Calkins, Jeffrey Wenger, Jeremy Eckhause, Craig Bond, Tiffany Berglund, Jack Kroger, Daniel Schwam, 2025  
RAND Research Report  
The report combined separate models estimating the impacts of resource allocation regular Army and reserve recruitment outcomes. I conducted a literature review and drafted appendix material on how academic and commercial researchers model the impact of multichannel marketing.

<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1229-3.html"> “National Guard Youth ChalleNGe and Job ChalleNGe: Metrics for Success,”  </a>  
Stephani L. Wrabel, Joshua Eagan, Grace Falgoust, Jenna W. Kramer, Jack Kroger, Jonah Kushner, Kata Mihaly, Peter Nguyen, Thomas E. Trail, Jennie W. Wenger, et al., 2024  
RAND Research Report  
This annual report tracks performance metrics for the National Guard’s Youth ChalleNGe and Job ChalleNGe programs. For the 2024 version, I merged ACS and social capital data from Opportunity Insights with administrative data on National Guard Youth Challenge program candidates to compare differences in economic mobility, poverty, and neighborhood characteristics for areas that Challenge candidates come from over time and relative to national averages.

<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2880-1.html"> “Intellectual, Developmental, and Physical Disabilities in U.S. Legal Settings: A Scoping Review,” </a>  
Stephanie Brooks Holliday, Andrew Scruggs, Allyson D. Gittens, Samantha Matthews, Catria Gadwah-Meaden, Rebecca L. Wolfe, Jack Kroger, Alina I. Palimaru, 2023  
RAND Research Report  
This report examined barriers to access and challenges that individuals with disabilities face while navigating the U.S. justice system. I participated in a literature scan and full text abstraction of identified papers to identify what barriers and challenges have been documented already in existing academic literature and legal reviews.

<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TLA3082-1.html"> “RAND Methodological Guidance for Conducting and Critically Appraising Delphi Panels,” </a>  
Dmitry Khodyakov, Sean Grant, Jack Kroger, Melissa Bauman, 2023  
RAND Research Report  
This research tool summarizes guidance from various sources and provides recommendations on how to best conduct and appraise the results from a Delphi Panel. I assisted with the literature scan and text review and drafted multiple chapters for the report that proceeds the final appraisal tool.
